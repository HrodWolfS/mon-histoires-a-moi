EXPLANATION OF THE PROJECT

This project is called **Mon Histoire à moi** and is a front-only MVP that generates **personalized AI-generated children’s stories** directly in the browser.

### Purpose

To provide an engaging and magical storytelling experience for children aged 3 to 10 by allowing parents or educators to personalize stories with:

- the names and roles of characters,
- the choice of story theme,
- and an optional moral or lesson to teach.

### Architecture

- 100% front-end application
- No user authentication
- The OpenAI API key is provided by the user and stored locally (never sent to a backend)
- All generation (text, image, audio) happens via client-side fetch to OpenAI
- User stories are stored locally (IndexedDB or localStorage)

### Features

- **Wizard**: input character name/age/role, theme, and moral
- **Text Generation** using GPT, adapted to the child’s age
- **Illustration** generation using DALL·E
- **Audio narration** using Whisper (if desired)
- **Reading interface**: split layout with text, image, and audio playback
- **Story persistence**: all stories are stored locally and can be exported/imported

### Goals

- Deliver a frictionless and fun user experience
- Showcase technical skills in API integration, front-end architecture, and user experience
- Provide an open and educational demonstration of modern AI capabilities
